Summary: Technical details about Oculus Medium's Move Tool
I wrote several blog posts about Oculus Medium's Move Tool that are hosted on the Oculus Developer Blog:

I also wrote this blog post which is a detailed explanation of the mesh deformation that is guided by the 6DoF controllers:

There is also sample code that was released by Facebook/Oculus under the BSD license, which you can find at:
