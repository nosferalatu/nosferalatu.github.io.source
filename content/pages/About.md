Summary: About Me
My name is David Farrell. I work as a software engineer specializing in graphics and high performance programming.

I'm currently employed at [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com). In the past, I've worked at [Oculus](http://www.oculus.com), [Double Fine Productions](http://www.doublefine.com), [Nihilistic Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NStigate_Games), [Stormfront Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_Studios), [Rendition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendition_(company)), and a few other gigs here and there.

I began programming on a Commodore VIC-20 when I was young and promptly ran out of memory. It's a problem I'm still running into today!
