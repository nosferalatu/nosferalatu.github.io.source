Summary: About Me
My name is David Farrell. I work as a computer game programmer specializing in graphics, high performance, and low-level programming.

I'm currently employed at [Double Fine Productions](http://www.doublefine.com). In the past, I've worked at [Zoe Mode](http://www.zoemode.com/), [Nihilistic Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NStigate_Games), [Stormfront Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_Studios), [Rendition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendition_(company)), and a few other gigs here and there.

I started programming when I was seven years old with a Commodore VIC-20.
